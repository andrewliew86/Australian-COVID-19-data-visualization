# COVID-19-infections-visualization
Background: Raw data on COVID-19 cases, deaths and recoveries are readily available but require pre-processing prior to visualization which can be time consuming.

Results: I created a Python script that transforms the raw .csv data into a usable format for data visualization of COVID-19 infections and outcomes in Australia. Users can place all raw .csv files in a folder and the script will help create three charts showing the number of cases, deaths and recoveries. The figure below shows the number of cases, deaths and recoveries in two major Australian states (NSW and Victoria) from 1 March to 15 April 2020.

Raw .csv data can be downloaded from:  https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series

Python libraries/tools: Pandas, matplotlib
