# COVID-19-visualization
Challenge: Raw data on COVID-19 cases, deaths and recoveries are readily available but require pre-processing prior to visualization

Solution: I created a Python script that transforms the raw csv data into a usable format for data visualization of COVID-19. Users can place all raw .csv files in a folder and the script will help create three charts showing the number of cases, deaths and recoveries. 

Raw data are avaialble from:  https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series
